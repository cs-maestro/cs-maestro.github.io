I am a motivated **Masterâ€™s student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.unm.edu) at the [University of New Mexico (UNM)](https://www.unm.edu)**, Albuquerque, NM. I work under the advisement of [Afsah Anwar](https://www.afsah.org) in the [Beyond Defense Lab](https://www.afsah.org/lab). I completed my undergraduate studies in **Computer Science** at UNM in Spring 2025.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Security**, **Privacy**, **Internet Measurement**, and **Machine Learning (LLMs)**. I have collaborated with researchers at **CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security**, the **University of Louisiana**, and the **University of Arizona**.
