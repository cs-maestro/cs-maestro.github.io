I am a motivated Masterâ€™s student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.unm.edu) at the [University of New Mexico (UNM)](https://www.unm.edu), Albuquerque, NM. I work under the advisement of [Afsah Anwar](https://www.afsah.org) in the [Beyond Defense Lab](https://www.afsah.org/lab). I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at UNM in Spring 2025.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Security, Privacy, Internet Measurement, and Machine Learning. I have collaborated with researchers at CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, the University of Louisiana, and the University of Arizona.
